The LeftValues Quiz measures and analyzes various aspects of left-wing political, social and economic viewpoints over the course of 72 questions, with seven axes of values. LeftValues is based upon [8values](https://8values.github.io/).

### Contributions

Translations were previously handled through the WebLate app, but since 2023 the provider of this application has been unavailable. This project is no longer actively maintained, but corrections to translations and new translations can still be submitted as pull requests by editing the .json files in the lang directory. New questions and axes are not being considered, but feel free to create your own forks that expand upon and modify LeftValues.
